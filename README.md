Mandatory dependencies:
-----------------------
Numerical Python (http://numpy.scipy.org)


Optional dependencies:
-----------------------
PyFFTW3 (https://launchpad.net/pyfftw)
will greatly speed up the NSGT transformation is fftw3 is installed on your system

scikits.audiolab (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.audiolab)
is needed for using the built-in audio import/streaming functionality


Installation:
-------------

Directly from GitHub:

``pip install git+git://github.com/grrrr/nsgt@master``

Note: if you are using Python3 on macOS or Linux, you may wish to replace `pip` with `pip3`.

ToDO:
-----

- Quality measurement for coefficients of sliced transform
- Unify nsgfwin sliced/non-sliced
